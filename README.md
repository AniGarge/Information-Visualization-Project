## Information Visualization Project (IST719)

This project involves the detailed data analysis of all the attributes listed in the FIFA Player dataset to identify the best players in every position and predict the team of the year which would help the online players in competitions to purchase better players in each position and perform well. Data Visualization is the main technique used to generate interactive charts to deliver actual insights.
